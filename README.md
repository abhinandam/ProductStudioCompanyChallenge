# Mozilla Company Challenge

How might we create a payment solution that services all publishers without subscriptions and makes users feel good about paying for content?

# Product Narrative

In the not so distant future, tiered subscription models will regulate access to large swaths of the internet. Browser-based authentication and sharing provides a temporary means of bypassing paywalls and facilitates content discovery, allowing users to make better purchasing decisions.

# Narrative Complete Product

Our chrome plugin allows users to share URLs amongst their friends groups and view the links shared with them, encouraging content discovery without having to go through a third-party service.
